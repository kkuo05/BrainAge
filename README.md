A PC-based cognitive training game inspired by Nintendo's Brain Age series, combining fast-paced arithmetic challenges with handwritten input recognition.

## Project Overview

BrainAge++ is an educational math game that challenges players to solve arithmetic problems by writing their answers directly on screen. The game combines:

- A CNN model trained on MNIST for handwritten digit recognition (98.1%+ accuracy)
- Multi-stage Pygame-based GUI
- Progressive difficulty system

## Current Status

⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
- MNIST digit classification model complete (see `model_training.ipynb`)
- Pygame interface in development (coming soon)
